# Add ID to Links

Wordpress plugin to add an ID to all links in post/page content.

This is useful for Google Analytics Enhanced Link Attribution, which works best when each link on a page has a unique ID, especially if there are multiple links to the same destination. This plugin adds a unique ID to all links in page and post content that don't already have an ID attribute set. The plugin does not add IDs to links in the header, footer, sidebars, or other areas outside the post or page content.
